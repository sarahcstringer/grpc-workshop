# Chat Application Workshop

## Existing application

The existing application is a chat app that allows clients to send messages to a general chat room.

## Your Task

Add the notion of a User to this service, and keep track of which user
sends a particular message. When displaying messages, display the username of the
user who sent the message in front of the text of their message. Example:

```
alice: hi, this is alice
bob: hi, it's bob
```

## Stretch goal

Implement a direct message feature. If a user sends a message that begins with `@<existing username>`,
send that message to only that user. No one else in the chat should receive that particular message.
